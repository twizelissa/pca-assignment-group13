# 🧠 PCA Assignment - Group 13

This repository contains the complete submission for **Formative 2: Principal Component Analysis**, as required in the Machine Learning module at ALU.

It includes:
- An implementation of PCA from scratch
- A dynamic component selection using explained variance
- Visualizations before and after dimensionality reduction
- Handwritten eigenvalue calculations
- A custom Python matrix library published to PyPI
